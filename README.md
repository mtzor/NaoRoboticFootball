 The robotstadium_nao_vs_robotis-op2.wbt world, which is provided by the Webots environment, is used for this project.
 
 In this sample world Nao Robots are football players and the environment simulated is a football match.
 Webots provides users with a sample controller for the robots.

 This projects is an extension of a simple java controller for the robots, provided by the Autonomus Agents course

 controller with more complex beahaviour and features for the Nao Robots.

 Some of the features mentioned above are:

 +Player collision avoidance feature is designed, utilising the sonar sensors and bumpers of each robot
